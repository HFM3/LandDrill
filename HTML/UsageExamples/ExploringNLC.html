		<h2>National Land Cover Database Exploration</h2>
		<p><b>Land Drill</b>  can be used with the National Land Cover Database to identify, locate, and summarize all the land change that occurs within the Contiguous United States for 2001, 2006, and 2011.</p>

		<h3>Understanding Image Outputs</h3>

		<p>When Land Drill generates images, it always generates two copies. One copy uses the true pixel values and is intended for use with geo-software and analyses. The second copy uses pixels values that are scaled between 0 and 255. The scaled, or normalized images, can be displayed with any photo viewer and easily incoprtated into documents and presentations.</p>

		<p><b>Images Generated by Land Drill</b> (.tiff)</p>

		<ol>
			<li><b>Core Count Image</b> (Real32)</li>
			An image where each pixel's value is equal to the number of times that pixel's core sample appears throughout the scene.
			<li><b>State Count Image</b> (Byte)</li>
			An image where each pixel's value is equal to the number of distinct land cover types found within the core sample that was extracted from that pixel's location. Any state count can be derrived from the State Count Image.
			<li><b>Single State Core Sample Image</b> (Boolean, Byte)</li>
			A Boolean image that marks the location of land cover persistence.
			<li><b>Multi-State Core Sample Image</b> (Boolean, Byte)</li>
			A Boolean image that marks the location of pixels that experience any land cover change.
			<li><b>Maximum State Core Sample Image</b> (Boolean, Byte)</li>
			A Boolean image that marks the location of pixels that had core samples with the highest number of distinct land cover types.
		</ol>

		<p>The brighter a pixel is in the Core Count Image, the more times its core sample appears throughout the image. Many times, the brightest pixels correspond to land cover persistence. When viewed within geo-software and colorized with a palette, the core count image may better reveal where identical cores exist.</p>

		<p>Land Drill will also produce a pair of images that identify core samples that experienced any amount changed.</p>


		<p>Likewise, another pair of images are produced to identify all core samples that did not experience any change.</p>

		<p>Any other state count of interest can be derrived from the State Count Image. Pixel values are equal to the number of distinct land cover types found within each core sample.</p>

		<h3>Core Sample Locator</h3>

		<p>The <b>Core Sample Locator</b> tool can be used to identify specific core samples or transitions. Any core sample can be located. The <b>Pixel History Report</b> can help identify interesting core samples to locate.</p>

		<center><p><i>Grassland -> Grassland -> Crop</i></p></center>

		<p>Multiple cores / transitions can be located and and merged together with an image calculator or photo editing software.</p>

		<p>Because Land Drill generates a copy of each image that does not require geo-software to view, core samples can be located and merged into visually stunning maps with photo editing software.</p>
