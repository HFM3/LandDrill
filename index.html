		<p><b>Land Drill</b> is a raster GIS tool that can identify, locate, and summarize large amounts of land change for many time points at once.</p>

		<p>Land Drill is written in the Wolfram Language and produces a series of images and .csv reports that visually and textually summarize all pixel-level changes that occur within the temporal extent of an image series.</p>

		<h1>Nearly Limitless</h1>

		<p>Land Drill has been designed to accept any number of input images that have any number of categoriesâ€” even if the categories vary from image to image. The only limitation to Land Drill's capability is the power of the computer running it.</p>

		<p>Land Drill is free from many of the common restrictions imposed by similar raster GIS tools, such as TerrSet's Land Change Modeler and Crosstab module.</p>

		<ol>
			<li style="color:indianred;">That the legends of each map are the same.</li>
			<li style="color:indianred;">That the categories in each map are sequential.</li>
			<li style="color:indianred;">That only two maps be used at once.</li>
			<li style="color:indianred;">That "No Data" pixels have a value of zero.</li>
			<li style="color:indianred;">That the background in both maps are the same.</li>
			<li style="color:indianred;">That input images cannot contain more than 128 categories.</li>
			<li style="color:indianred;">That the output image cannot have more than 256 categories.</li>
		</ol>


		<p>Land Drill requires only:</p>
		<ol>
			<li style="color:SeaGreen;">That the input maps are single layer TIFFs.</li>
			<li style="color:SeaGreen;">That the input maps have identical numbers of rows and columns.</li>
		</ol>

		<h1>How it Works</h1>

		<p>Land Drill works by stacking the input image series and drilling for a core sample at the position of each pixel. Once every core sample is extracted, all duplicate core samples are removed and tallied so that each distinct core sample is reported only once.</p>

		<h3>What is a Core Sample?</h3>
		<p>A core sample is the complete history of each pixel in a time series. Core samples are what power Land Drill and its reports.</p>

		<p>Land Drill processes the extracted core samples and generates several reports and images.</p>

		<p><b>Summary Reports</b> (.csv)</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Pixel History Report</b></li>
			A report that contains every distinct core sample and the number of times it appeared throughout the scene.
			<li><b>Start / End State Report</b></li>
			A report that contains every distinct first and last core sample layer combination that occurred. The Start / End State Report is used to determine how many pixels started as X and became Y.
			<li><b>Interior Layer Variation Report</b></li>
			A report that contains every distinct core sample where the first and last layers were identical, but at least one layer in between varied. The Interior Layer Variation Report is used to detect possible pixel classification  errors.
			<li><b>Single State Core Sample Report</b></li>
			A report that contains every distinct core sample that did not experience change. The maximum number of possible records in the Single State Core Sample Report is equal to the number of land cover categories.
			<li><b>Bi-State Core Sample Report</b></li>
			A report that contains every distinct core sample that was comprised of exactly two different land cover types.
			<li><b>Maximum State Core Sample Report</b></li>
			A report that contains every distinct core sample that contained the maximum number of different land cover types. The Maximum State Core Sample Report is used to detect which pixels changed at every time point, or nearly every time point.
		</ol>
		<br>

		<p><b>Images Generated by Land Drill</b> (.tiff)</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Core Count Image</b> (Real32)</li>
			An image where each pixel's value is equal to the number of times its core sample appeared throughout the scene.
			<li><b>State Count Image</b> (Byte)</li>
			An image where each pixel's value is equal to the number of distinct land cover types found within the core sample that was extracted from that pixel's location. Any state count can be derrived from the State Count Image.
			<li><b>Single State Core Sample Image</b> (Boolean, Byte)</li>
			A Boolean image that marks the location of all land cover persistence.
			<li><b>Multi-State Core Sample Image</b> (Boolean, Byte)</li>
			A Boolean image that marks the location of all pixels that experience any land cover change.
			<li><b>Maximum State Core Sample Image</b> (Boolean, Byte)</li>
			A Boolean image that marks the location of all pixels that had core samples with the highest number of distinct land cover types.
		</ol>

		<p>When Land Drill generates images, it always generates two copies. One copy uses the true pixel values and is intended for use with geo-software and analyses. The second copy uses pixels values that have been scaled between 0 and 255. The scaled, or normalized images, can be displayed with any photo viewer and easily incoprtated into documents and presentations. Boolean images are not scaled. Instead, Boolean images are exported as bit images. Bit images have much smaller file sizes and can be displayed with any photo viewer and easily incoprtated into documents and presentations.</p>
